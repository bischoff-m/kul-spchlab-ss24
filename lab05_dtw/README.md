## Exercises

The purpose of these exercises is to get hands on experience with the basic principles of dynamic time warping, a key concept in speech recognition and sequence recognition in general.

The exercises are very simple but do involve quite a few - extremely simple - computations.   
We strongly believe that doing these exercises BY HAND without any help from any computer implementations helps full understanding.
