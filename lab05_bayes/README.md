# LAB05: Bayesian Classification using a Generative Model


## Background

- The notebook **[Bayesian Classification](Bayes.md)**  gives a brief refresh on Bayes formula and its application in classification problems.   

- **Standard Normal Distribution [\[HTML\]](https://compi1234.github.io/spchlab/Tutorials/StandardNormalDistribution.html)  [\[notebook\]](StandardNormalDistribution.ipynb)** can be used to review the standard normal distribution or plain to do lookup of values


##### Exercises

- **Gender Classification with Pitch as Feature**
   + Use your pitch measurements from lab03 to come up with a probabilistic answer if the person speaking was male or female.   ALL NECESSARY computations are easily done by hand. Make use of the graphs that you find in [Hillenbrand Pitch Distributions](https://compi1234.github.io/spchlab/Tutorials/PitchDistribution.html)
   + Now, verify your results in the notebook [Pitch2Gender.ipynb](Pitch2Gender.ipynb)   

- **Vowel Classification using Formants as Features**
   + Use your formant measurements from lab03  and use them in [Formants2Vowel.ipynb](Formants2Vowel.ipynb)
