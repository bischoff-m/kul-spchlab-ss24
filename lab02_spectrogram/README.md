# JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS on SPECTROGRAMS

## Exercises

1. **Filtered_signals.ipynb** :
   + Exercise 1: Speech with Telephone Bandwidth
   + Exercise 2: Redundancy in bandpass-filtered Speech
   + Exercise 3: Filtering of Harmonic Signals

The main purpose of these exercises is to appreciate the complex transformation from spectrum to perception that is happening in our brain.  
We show that large parts of the signal can be filtered out without destroying our speech understanding, though there is always a notable twist in quality.

1. **Spectrogram.ipynb** :
   + Exercise 1: Phonetic Segmentations
   + Exercise 2: Fourier Spectrogram: parameters

Overlaying phonetic segmentations on a speech spectrogram illustrates well that there is a discrepancy between the continuity of
the speech signal and the discreteness of any symbolic (grapheme or phonetic) representation.  Phonetic boundaries
are more often than not fluid and not instantaneous.
A spectrogram is a time-frequency representation. It sounds generic, but different parameter settings may give you a very different 'view'.
Discover for yourself the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of spectral analysis.  At the same time find those parameters that best aligns
the spectrographic view with perception in general.

1. **Mel_Spectrogram.ipynb** :
   + Exercise 1: Mel Spectrogram

These exercises focus on properties of **human** speech and hearing.  
The mel spectrogram is especially adapted to the frequency scale of the human ear.  
Some things look similar, some a little different ...
