#  JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS on SPECTROGRAMS


## Exercises


1. **Filtered_signals.ipynb** :

    + Exercise 1: Speech with Telephone Bandwidth
    + Exercise 2: Redundancy in bandpass-filtered Speech
    + Exercise 3: Filtering of Harmonic Signals
    
The main purpose of these exercises is to complex transformation from spectrum to perception that is happening in our brain.   
We show that large parts of the signal can be filtered out without destroying our understanding.  


2. **Spectrograms_basics.ipynb** : 

    + Exercise 1: Phonetic Segmentations   
        illustrate the illusion of hard phonetic boundaries
        use sliders to zoom in on small details to verify the transcriptions
        
    + Exercise 2: Fourier Spectrogram: parameters   
        discover how the parameters should be in line with what you key properties of human speech and general psychoacoustic findings
      


3. **Spectrograms_advanced.ipynb**: 

Explore different spectral representations such as the mel spectrogram, cepstrogram, .. and visualize spectral slices as well as the global spectrogram itself   
     
    + Exercise 1: Mel Spectrogram     
    + Exercise 2: Spectrogram: pitch and formants
