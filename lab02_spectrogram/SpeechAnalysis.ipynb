    "\n",
    "Any spectrogram or spectral slice is obtained by analyzing in long signal in successive short frames, a so called sliding window approach.\n",
    "This sliding window should not be too short, not too long, not too much overlap, ....\n",
    "\n",
    "The default parameters are shift=10msec, length=25msec, preemphasis=.97\n",
    "    + describe what you observe when deviating from the defaults\n",
    "    + for what parameters and in what way does the spectrogram deviate from speech perception ?\n",
    "    + choose as frame_length 10, 30, 50, 100 msec. Which values would you describe as good, acceptable, not acceptible and why ?\n",
    "    + choose as frame_shift 5,10, 20 msec. Which values would you describe as good, acceptable, not acceptable and why ?\n",
    "    + Have you discovered the Heisenberg principle for speech ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive spectrogram visualizes speech in the time-frequency domain.\n",
    "Some form of time-frequency analysis is the first processing step in the human auditory system in equally so\n",
    "in speech recognition systems.\n",
    " \n",
    "A Fourier Spectrogram is obtained by letting a sliding window make short time spectra and by viewing this in a 2D heatmap\n",
    "we may see which frequencies are present at which moment in time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we focus on elementary usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- as a popular Time-Frequency view of speech and audio signals in which we may discover the cognitive relevant elements (sounds, acoustic events, ... )\n",
