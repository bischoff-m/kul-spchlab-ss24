## Exercise1 - Computing with HMMs

The purpose of this exercise is do basic computations, such as Viterbi alignment, with a given HMM.

The HMMs used are very simple, but as you will experience, they get involved quite quickly.
Doing these BY HAND will help you in understanding how the problem gets manageable by splitting the observation probabilities out of 
trellis computations.   Doing backtracking also shows how crucial it is to have this forward-backward setup to get to the optimal probabilities and
alginments.
