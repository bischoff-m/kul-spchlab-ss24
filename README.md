# spchlab - Speech Recognition Demos and Exercises

*spchlab* is a Repository of Jupyter Noteboobs for Speech Recognition Demos, Tutorials and Exercises.

Different topics are organized by folder (LABxx_name). Each of these is rather independent.  It is not strictly necessary to follow the order of the labs, but a higher numbered lab is likely to build on knowledge and skills acquired in lower numbered lab sessions.   

### The Notebooks
