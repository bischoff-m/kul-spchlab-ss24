# spchlab - Speech Recognition Tutorials and Exercises

*spchlab* is a Repository of Jupyter Noteboobs for Speech Recognition Demos, Tutorials and Exercises. 

Different topics are organized by folder (LABxx_name). Each of these is rather independent.  It is not strictly necessary to follow the order of the labs, but a higher numbered lab is likely to build on knowledge and skills acquired in lower numbered lab sessions.   

Each lab-folder contains:
- a README.md file with a general description of the folder contents and links to the tutorials, demos and exercises  
- a number of tutorial notebooks *\<Name>.ipynb*.  Web versions of these
 can be viewed directly via github-pages.  The tutorial notebooks were also used for the generation of many figures in the course notes.
- a number of exercises in text *\<Ex_name>.md* or in notebook *\<Ex_name>.ipynb* format
