TBD

- separate mel-scale as concept from mel-scale filterbank implementation
the pyspchoacoustic experiments only require the concept; the FB implementation fits in the feature_extraction exercises

- timit1 & timit3 can be further integrated
  a. feature extraction + GMM on mfcc13, mel24, mel80
  b. add delta's
  c. MLP
