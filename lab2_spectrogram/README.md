#  JUPYTER-LAB EXERCISES on SPECTROGRAMS


## Jupyter Notebooks

- [Filtered_signals.ipynb] : experiment with low-pass and band-pass filters on speech and artificial signals
- [formants.ipynb] : from spectrogram to formant scatter-plot 


## Exercises

1. **Spectrograms.ipynb** : spectrogram, cepstrogram, .. with flexible parameters and segmental zoom or split screen with spectrogram in LHS and spectral slice in RHS selected by slider.

    + Exercise 1: Phonetic Segmentations
    + Exercise 2: Fourier Spectrogram: parameters
    + Exercise 3: Spectrogram: pitch and formants


2. **Filtered_signals.ipynb** :

    + Exercise 1: Speech with Telephone Bandwidth
    + Exercise 2: Redundancy in bandpass-filtered Speech
    + Exercise 3: Filtering of Harmonic Signals
