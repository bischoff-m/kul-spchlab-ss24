# LAB01: SPEECH and AUDIO

## Purpose

This folder contains demonstrations and exercises on the *psychoacoustics* of speech and audio, trying to answer following questions:   
- How do we hear ?  
- Which physical properties of the signal correlate to what element in our perception ?


## Notebooks

#### Keyboard.ipynb

A very gentle introduction to the concept of pitch (tone on a musical scale)


#### HarmonicSignals.ipynb

A GUI for experimenting with perception of harmonic signals.   The goal is to show that frequency content has correlates along 3 perceptual axis:   
- **pitch**: short time periodicity results in a pitch percept, typically in the 20-400Hz range
- **timbre**: spectral envelope shaping the intensities of the pitch harmonics determine the timbre of signals; e.g. for speech it is the key to determine the differences between vowels
- **rhythm**: repetitions at a rate lower than about 15Hz are not perceived as a frequency but as some event repeating over time  


#### AuditoryDemonstrations.ipynb

This is a wrapper notebook around some of the demos on the "IPO Auditory Demonstration CD".  A small GUI and a spectrographic view are additions provided to the purely auditive demonstrations that we start from.
