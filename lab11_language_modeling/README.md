# RNN language modeling

This is a Jupyter Notebook on RNN language modeling for the course [Speech Recognition](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02A6AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp33776) (Master Artificial Intelligence) at KU Leuven.

## Goals of the exercise

This exercise gives a demonstration of the basics of language modeling with recurrent neural networks.
The different aspects of the work involved are illustrated: data processing, word embeddings, testing a network and hyperparameter tuning. By running it from a Notebook, little or no programming experience is expected from the user.

##  Google Colab, Python, TensorFlow

This exercise should be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which is a collabarative workspace in the cloud giving you easy access to GPUs.
GPUs are required for this exercise to run in an acceptable amount of time.

This notebook contains Python code. Most of the code (with the explanation) will be self-explanatory. It also makes extensive use of the TensorFlow package for DNN training.  It is the computational workhorse for our exercise.

Dependencies (as of 12/12/2021):

- rnn_lm.ipynb 
  + Python 3.6 or above  (current standard in Colab)
  + Tensorflow V1.0  still supported by Colab, but will be deprecated at some point
