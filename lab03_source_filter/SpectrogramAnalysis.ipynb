    "+ use Spd.iSpectrogram(type=2), espcially to see spectral slices where the cursor is\n",
    "+ use the Range Slider to select parts to pview\n",
    "+ suggested files to use:\n",
    "    - demo/female2.wav (female, wideband),   female2_8k  is a narrowband version of the same\n",
    "    - demo/male1.wav (male, narrowband)\n",
    "    - demo/timit_f1_sa2.wav                  the same \"SA2\" sentence by a female\n",
    "    - demo/timit_m1_sa2.wav                          and male person\n",

    "#### Ex1. Extracting pitch and formants in time and/or frequency domain\n",
    "+ for 'demo/female2': analyze the speech (vowels) at time=1.80sec and time=3.45sec\n",
    "+ find pitch in three ways (for the first measurement)\n",
    "    - finding the period in the time waveform\n",
    "    - find harmonic distance in a spectral slice (e.g. count how many in a 1kHz range)\n",

    "+ now look at the different time instances: are these pitch estimates consistent ? are the deviations \"within range of expectations\" ?  explain the differences if any \n",
    "+ what is (roughly) the pitch range that you observe for this speaker in this single sentence ?\n",

    "+ some of the above tasks are indeed (very) difficult, given the views that you have. What is lacking in your opinion, what is the problem (the information is there as you can recognize the sounds easily when you listen)\n",
    "+ save your measured values of pitch and formants for future exercises !\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ex2. Pitch and formants in the mel spectrum\n",
    "+ make sure you are up to date on the mel-scale\n",
    "+ add the mel spectrogram (and mel spectrum slice) to your view  (start with high resolution: set  to 80 bands if sr=16kHz, 64 bands if sr=8kHz)\n",
    "+ Look for the 10th harmonic both in the linear spectrum and in the mel spectrum - what's the most striking difference\n",
